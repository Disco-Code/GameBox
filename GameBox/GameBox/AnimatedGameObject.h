/// Used to set up animated Game Objects.
/// ===How To Use==
/// 1) Find/create a sprite sheet that contains the animated frames.
///		1a) The spritesheet can contain multiple animations.
///		1b) Animations does not have to have the same amount of frames.
///		1c) Animations are updated from left to right in the sheet, animations can span multiple rows and will automatically go down one row then reaching the last frame on current the row.
///		1d) Each new animation HAS to start on a new row in the sheet.
/// 2) Create a AnimatedGameObject.
///		2a) Constructor need to know the number of rows and columns of the sheet that will be used.
/// 3) call "setTexture" to set the sheet.
/// 4) call "addAnimation" for each unique animation the sprite contain.
///		4a) addAnimation should be called for the animations in the same order as they are organized in the sheet from top to bottom.
///	5) Call update each frame to progress the animation
/// 6) Call "setAnimation" set select which animation to run.
/// 7) If the animation is updated to fast or to slow, setAnimationSpeed can be called to modify the animation speed.
///		7a) Input to setAnimationSpeed is "frames per second" (24 is default)
